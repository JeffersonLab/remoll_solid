bggen is the hall d photoproduction code I imported for SoLID background simulations. The modifications are made to allow electroproduction event generation with this code. For now hall D code can only produce events for proton target only.

For now full hall d simulation environment needs to be setup to run this code. I have not put any instruction to do this step here.

Once the code is running there modify beam current and target length for the proton target by modifying the FORTRAN file,
     bggen/code/bremsbeam_ini.F



This generator will produce paw ntuple called bggen.nt that will contain the generated events

In the macro file fort.15 modify the random number and no.of events to be generated 

Once the  bggen.nt file is generated ntuple can be converted to a root TTree using h2root executable provided by the root software package. Once converted use the script scripts/HallD_LH_xs.cc to generate LUND files and kinematics plots


List of files modfied in bggen to enable electro-production


A       code/bremsbeam_ini.F
M       code/cohbeam_ini.F
M       code/pythia_h.F
M       code/bg_evec.inc
M       code/lowen_ini.F
M       code/lowen_eve.F
M       code/bg_ntup_ini.F
M       code/pyth_eve.F
M       code/bg_eve.F
M       code/bg_ini.F


Most of the changes are minor except code/bremsbeam_ini.F file where main code to allow electroproduction implemented.
