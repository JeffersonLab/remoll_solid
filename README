Repository information is here:
http://solid.physics.umass.edu/remoll_solid.html

---------------------------------------------------


Packages to build this:

>=Geant4.9.5
cmake > 2.6
root
python
git (optional)
boost (optional)

---------------------------------------------------

Instructions:

To build, create the directory you would like to 
build in, say build

mkdir build
cd build
cmake <path to remoll>
make

The field map can be found here:

http://hallaweb.jlab.org/12GeV/SoLID/download/field/CLEO_rm.dat

An example macro will be found in 

macros/

You need to load libremollroot.so if you want to access 
the classes written out to the ROOT files.  Building
remoll will create a rootlogon.C which will do this
automatically.

Visualization

Visualization macros are found in vis/

To run, execute

./remoll 

which should bring up a graphical command interface

To see the geometry:

/control/execute macros/vis.mac
